<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with Statechart modeling, simulation, testing and code generation. We will use <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/">itemis CREATE</a> (formerly called &quot;YAKINDU Statechart Tools&quot;).
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Download <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/products/itemis-create/download-options/">itemis CREATE</a>.</li>
  <li> Get a <a href="https://info.itemis.com/products/itemis-create/academic/order/?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.itemis.com%2F">free academic license</a> (sign up with your university e-mail).</li>
  <li> Start itemis CREATE and create a new workspace.</li>
  <li> Clone the <a href="https://github.com/joeriexelmans/MBSE4DT-Statecharts">StartingPoint git repository</a> into your itemis CREATE workspace, and import it as a project (without copying the files).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Introduction to Assignment</h2>
<p>We will use the Statecharts formalism to model a software controller for a crane that picks up and drops off containers.</p>
<p>The crane can move horizontally (&quot;move&quot;) and vertically (&quot;hoist&quot;), and it has an electromagnet that can be turned on/off to pickup/drop-off containers.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>We assume that several components already exist. These components are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Scheduler</b>: Determines in what order and where to pickup/drop-off containers</li>
  <li><b>Crane Control</b>: Controls the motors of the crane. Given a position, the crane control can make the crane move to that position.</li>
  <li><b>Emergency Panel</b>: A panel with two buttons: STOP and RESUME. In case of emergency, the STOP button will temporarily stop all crane movement.</li>
</ul>

<figure>

  <figcaption>Emergency Panel</figcaption>
</figure>

The Statechart model sits in between these components, and communicates with them only via (asynchronous) <em>events</em>.

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

<p>For interaction with each of the assumed components, a fixed interface is provided. This interface is already implemented in the starting point Statechart file.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <!-- <li>set of moves</li> -->
  <li id="safe-altitude"><b>Safe altitude</b>: If the crane is at a safe altitude, this means that it can move horizontally without bumping in to stacked containers, even while carrying a container. This altitude is defined as a constant in the Statechart.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behavioral Requirements</h2>

<ol start="0" class="requirements">
<!--   <li>The Statechart is always in one of two states:
    <ul>idle</ul>
    <ul>
  </li>
 -->
  <li>Initially, you may assume the magnet is off, the crane is at a <a href="#safe-altitude">safe altitude</a>, and not moving in any direction.</li>
  <li>Immediately at startup, the Statechart will raise the output event <tt>ready</tt> to indicate that it can make its first set of moves.</li>
  <li>After raising <tt>ready</tt>, the Statechart remains idle, waiting for the Scheduler to instruct it with the next move.
  <li>The next move is instructed by the Scheduler by raising 3 input events at the same time, in the following order: first <tt>setTargetX</tt> and <tt>setTargetY</tt>, whose parameters indicate the X,Y position to move to, which the Statechart should remember for later (in an internal variable), followed by the input event <tt>makeMove</tt>, indicating that the Statechart can start making its move.
  </li>
  <li>A move always consists of the following sequence:
    <ol>
      <li>Start moving horizontally to the horizontal target position.</li>
      <li>When this horizontal movement is complete, the Statechart should wait 500 ms before proceeding.</li>
      <li>Then, start moving vertically downwards to the vertical target position.</li>
      <li>When the vertical movement has complete, again, the Statechart should wait 500 ms before proceeding.</li>
      <li>The magnet is <em>toggled</em> (meaning: if the magnet was off, it is turned on, or if it was on, it is turned off).</li>
      <li>We wait another 500 ms.</li>
      <li>The crane starts moving vertically upwards, to the <a href="#safe-altitude">safe altitude</a>.</li>
      <li>After the vertical movement has completed, we wait yet another 500 ms.</li>
      <li>The Statechart raises the <tt>ready</tt> output event to indicate that it is ready for the next move.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>While making a move, the Statechart must ignore the following incoming events: <tt>setTargetX</tt>, <tt>setTargetY</tt>, <tt>makeMove</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>An emergency stop can always be made (whether the crane is idle or not). During an emergency stop, the crane stops responding to all input events, except those of the emergency buttons.</li>
  <li>An emergency stop consists of the following sequence:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>The emergency STOP-button is pressed.</li>
    <li>In response, the Statechart immediately requests the Crane Controller to stop all movement.</li>
    <li>After the crane has come to a standstill, the Statechart can respond to an emergency RESUME-button press.</li>
    <li>If the RESUME-button is pressed, the Statechart waits 2 seconds before resuming normal behavior...
      <ul>
        <li>If in this 2-second period, the STOP-button is pressed again, the resuming is canceled, and Statechart stays in emergency mode until the RESUME-button is pressed again, starting the 2-second period again.</li>
        <li>When the 2-second period is over, the activity that was happening when the emergency stop started, is resumed. For instance, if the crane was moving horizontally to pick up a container, it resumes this movement as if nothing happened, followed by the rest of the move (go down, toggle magnet, go up).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Testing your solution</h2>
There are a number of ways to test your solution:
<ul>
  <li><b>itemis built-in debugger</b>: allows interactive, real-time (NOT <em>scaled</em> real-time) simulation, where the user can raise any input event, change variables, etc. while observing the current state in the Statechart (white-box testing).
    <figure>
      <img src="itemis-debugger.png"/>
      <figcaption>Debug button in Itemis</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li><s><b>itemis testing framework</b>: allows for white-box and black-box automated as-fast-as-possible testing, by writing scripts that raise timed input events, and assertions on expected output events.</s><br/>
    We recommend against using the Itemis CREATE testing framework, as explained <a href="#why-not-yakindu-testing">at the end of this page</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Python GUI</b>: allows interactive, (scaled) real-time simulation. The complete trace of input- and output-events is recorded, and can be replayed by the Python testing framework (next point...)</li>
    <figure>
      <p>To run:</p>
      <tt>python runner_realtime_eventloop.py</tt>
    </figure>
  As shown in the <a href="#fig-sys-architecture">system architecture figure</a>, the Python GUI includes fake implementations of the non-statechart components:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Scheduler</b>: (non-interactive) will dispatch a hardcoded list of moves (defined in <tt>common.py</tt>).</li>
    <li><b>Crane Control</b>: (non-interactive) will respond to any request with a <tt>doneMoving</tt> event, after some time has passed (to simulate movement taking time).</li>
    <li><b>Emergency Button</b>: (interactive) implemented in the GUI with two clickable buttons.</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Python testing framework</b>: allows for black-box automated as-fast-as-possible testing, by writing sequences of input events and expected output events. The benefit of this custom framework, is that a failed test will print a <em>diff</em> between the expected and actual output traces, which is (in our experience) easy to understand.
    <figure>
      <p>To run:</p>
      <tt>python runner_tests.py</tt>
      <p>The script already contains two test cases (which are just Python lists of timestamped events). Have a look at the source code of this script, and feel free to extend it with more test cases.</p>
    </figure>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What is expected</h2>
<p>The assignment has been designed specifically to encourage use of as many Statechart features as possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>composite states</li>
  <li>orthogonal states</li>
  <li>timed transitions</li>
  <li>guard conditions</li>
  <li>transition actions</li>
  <li>enter/exit actions</li>
  <li>internal variables</li>
  <li>internal events</li>
  <li>history</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you understand these features, and use them, where you think they are appropriate.</p>
<p>To give you an indication of the complexity, my own solution consists of 21 states (not counting &quot;regions&quot;) and 19 transitions.</p>

<div class="box">
  <img src="caution.gif"/>
  <br/>
  Always ensure that your transitions have an event trigger or after-trigger. This gives you have much more control over when your transition will fire, resulting in a solution that is more likely correct and understandable.
  <br/>
  <b><u><em>Never</em></u></b> use:
  <ul>
    <li>after 0 s (can give strange behavior)</li>
    <li>after 1 ms (unless of course you really want to wait 1ms)</li>
    <li>always</li>
    <li>every X s</li>
    <li>(no trigger)</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="why-not-yakindu-testing">Why we don't use itemis CREATE's builtin testing framework</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If a test case fails, you only see the line of code containing the failed assertion (not even a stack trace, making it difficult to figure out the context of the failure).</li>
  <li>No ability to view an input/output trace, which is of didactic importance.</li>
  <li>Output events are not instantaneous. Instead, they remain active until the next RTC step occurs. This is <u>wrong</u>.</li>
